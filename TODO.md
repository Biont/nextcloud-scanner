# TODO

## Bugs / immediate stuff

* Add an spinner to show a scan in progress
* Figure out how to refresh the file view
* See if there's a PHP way to stream directly from stdout and not use a tmpfile
* Add some error handling
* Add some tests

## Roadmap

* Add settings to control colour, resoultion, device url
  * Possibly make these show up in a JS popup per scan (with defaults)
* Combine scanned pages into single PDF doc
* Clientside scanning sent via file upload?
  * (is it worth it? client could scan locally and then upload themselves...)
